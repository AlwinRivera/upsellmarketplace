                        How to Forecast Incremental Revenue from a New Upsell

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        Forecasting incoming revenue can be a hit-or-miss affair. Forecasts are normally made based on
                        historical performance. Future results can and will fluctuate. It is always much easier to
                        forecast expenses than it is to try and predict the volume of revenue your site will have over
                        any given period of time. That is where most entrepreneurs start. Once we have a solid idea
                        about monthly expenses, it becomes easier to have an idea about what it will take to become
                        profitable.

                        Many businesspeople try to develop two sets of revenue forecasts, one being a conservative
                        estimate and the other being more optimistic. At any rate, forecasting future revenue is a
                        worthwhile exercise, because if site owners’ hope to attract investors, they will need to have
                        some idea about the volume of revenue the site is likely to generate.

                    <p>
                        Now, there is a way that site owners’ can forecast incoming revenue with a pretty fair degree of
                        accuracy, by working with a subscription upselling service at Upsell Marketplace. Upsell
                        Marketplace specializes in sales, servicing, and fulfillment of physical and digital
                        subscriptions, and when your site is supported by a high volume of such recurring subscription
                        sales, you'll be able to accurately predict monthly revenues with relative certainty, since
                        you'll know ahead of time what the volume of subscription sales will be each month.

                        Upsell Marketplace provides in one single, easy step, a solution for clients that need to
                        monetize their sales funnels. The specialists are adept at managing upsells. For example, a

                        Upsell Marketplace guides clients in designing their own upsell of products, periodicals, and
                        programs; all of which will complement existing client site. The best part is - there is no
                        major investment on your part. For example, one could choose whether he wants to earn immediate
                        working capital from upselling, or if one would prefer to work toward building long-term future
                        revenue streams.

                        customers. Upsell Marketplace can also help lower your costs, as they have access to
                        group-negotiated wholesale rates from established suppliers of upsell programs.

                        The Upsell Marketplace fee structure is 100% performance based- always! If you are not
                        profitable, you pay nothing. It’s that simple. There is no purchasing inventory or stocking of
                        inventory, again, Upsell Marketplace does all this and even incurs the risk of obsolete
                        inventory. Costs of sales will reflect the lowest group-negotiated discounts available on the
                        market. Featured are several upsell options which include zero cost fulfillment, which means you
                        pay nothing for order handling, weight handling, picking, and packing.

                        Revenues will be deposited directly into your own bank account from your own Merchant Processing
                        Account. Upsell Marketplace also from time to time, conducts competitive auctions of receivables
                        for their clients. In this way, those that would choose to realize immediate profits. (For

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        Traditionally, it has been extremely difficult for startup companies to forecast sales with any
                        degree of accuracy, and it is easy to see why. With no historical data to indicate any kind of
                        sales volume, one really does not have much to go on.

                        Conventional forecasting wisdom calls for including only about 20% of your customer base,
                        because that 20% is responsible for 80% of your business, but that simply is not the case with a
                        Recurring Subscription-Based Business. One can know with certainty exactly which customers to
                        include in his forecast, because they will be the ones who are subscribing currently, month
                        after month, year after year. One could also project exactly which customers are coming on board
                        this month because their subscriptions will be starting, and their revenues will be added to the
                        volume that you already have.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, we could even predict the number of new subscriptions that your site will be
                        picking up this month, based on the trend seen over the past few months. No need to make any
                        adjustments to consider seasonal factors such as holiday sales, because your subscription-based
                        business will forge ahead regardless of the changing seasons. In short, Clients have mentioned
                        repeatedly that their revenue growth projections have become greatly simplified after including
                        a recurring upsell subscription.

                        Now, try it yourself for free, just plug in to the yellow shaded area below, the 4 critical
                        assumptions about your current monthly volume (before any upsell), possible upsell price (hint:
                        $9.99 is our favorite), upsell success % (hint: usually 80%), persistency of recurring blocks of
                        business (say, 70%). We can refine this later; as everyone’s offer is unique, but this will at
                        least demonstrate the awesome power of a properly structure recurring subscription upsell.
